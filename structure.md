# Basic structure of the project

## Post generator
- Connection to OpenAI API
- Generate posts based on a random historical human event, with a title, body of minimum 500 words, conclusion and opinions on the topic
- Test the structure of the post before creating the file in the repo
- Implement retries in case tests fail, up to 3 retries before a notification is sent to the owner of the blog (Me)

## Tests
- Structure of the post is correct
    - It contains a title and a body
    - Needed structure for Pelican is present
    - Maybe test that pelican is able to process this post (?)
- Amount of words in post and body is between the permitted range

## Environment
- Host is primarly on github pages
- Run the script weekly with Github actions
- Make app testable locally by running Pelican server and making app routes change depending on the env

## Asthetic
- Clean, easy to look at, easy to maintain, nothing fancy
- HTML and CSS, maybe a little bit of JS
- One main page explaining the Blog, one page for list of posts, one page for standalone post

## Steps to follow
- Connect to OpenAI API
- Add safeguards to prevent over usage of balance
- First call for simple post in API
- Implement tests to make sure structure of the post is correct, doesn't matter the post content
- Create the testing environment with make commands for the next actions
    - Create a post
    - Run tests
    - Launch Pelican server
    - Move posts to deleted_posts folder
    - Create environment
- Inject desired behaviour of the AI Persona to the API call
- Keep track of the level of craziness the persona should have in the next post
- Make the AI learn from previous posts for the new posts to have a visible persona development
- Upload to Github pages
- Implement Github actions
- Release to public

## AI Usage constraints
- I can only use AI for HTML and CSS creation, none of the python code can be generated by AI

## Questions
- Should the posts be saved in a DB? (Maybe it over complicates such a simple structure)
- How to make the AI keep track of the Persona and make it evolve without giving context of all previous posts to the prompt?
- Should i host this in some separate service or Github pages is fine?
